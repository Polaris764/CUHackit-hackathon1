# CUHackit Hackathon

Project resulting from a 12 hour hackathon held by CUHackit. The project consists of a 2D game made in Godot and a Github Pages website that hosts the game and makes it playable on most platforms with internet browsers.

We decided to tackle the sustainability theme and game development category by making a tower defense game. Inspiration stems from the mass deforestation of our planet, forcing habitat loss for various creatures. The allies are various animal species and the enemies are lumberjacks trying to reach a forest.

## Authors

The 4 man hackathon team consisted of

* Alex Newman- Godot scripts and game construction
* Brown Muindi- CSS formatting and website deployment
* John Schelley- physical technology and math equations
* Sinan Berkman- art and sound direction/editing

## Usage

The final project page is https://nevahlucky.github.io/CUhackit/. Game source code can be found and imported to Godot under the "forest_game" project folder.

## Key Takeaways

* Delegation of tasks and trust of teammates to complete their roles is essential to teamwork. We each worked on different areas of the project and relied on the results to form a cohesive product.
* When put under time crunch, and even without, focus on the most important tasks is vital. Several idealistic goals had to be scrapped in favor of core project aspects.
* Communication within the team creates productive workflows focused on completing the main goal.
* Debugging small portions of code is far more efficient then untagling a full program worth of errors
* Consistent saves using git is a best practice, allowing you to visualize current progress and divide tasks into smaller steps
